# FlowTrack

FlowTrack is a simple and modern landing page for a productivity app concept.
The goal of this project was to focus on clean UI, clear content structure, and a smooth user experience without overcomplicating things.

This project was built as a frontend piece to demonstrate component-based development, responsive layouts, and modern styling using React and Tailwind CSS.

FlowTrack is designed to feel minimal, professional, and easy to use.
